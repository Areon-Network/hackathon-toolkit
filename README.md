# **The Toolkit for Code AREA**

Welcome to the ultimate toolkit repository designed to supercharge your Code AREA experience! ðŸš€

This repository is a curated collection of powerful tools and resources carefully crafted to empower developers and teams during hackathon events. Whether you're a seasoned hacker or a first-time participant, this toolkit is your go-to resource for accelerating your project development and enhancing collaboration.

## What's inside?

- ### Areon Request for Comment (ARC) Standards

  ARC1155, ARC721 & ARC20 code samples.

- ### Address Converter

  Areon uses two different addressing algorithms. One of them is the hexadecimal and the other one is a more reable and weight-efficient way of creating addresses. And we've built a tool in order to ease the problem of converting those addresses from one to another.

- ### Developer Experience
  You will use Solidity for writing contracts that work on ARC standards. And you need an integrated-development-environment or an IDE.
  
  [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) is a cloud-based online IDE that provides developers all the tooling they need.
  
  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) is a lightweight code editor that allows you to develop any language, including Solidity.  
  


## So, what's next?

Don't let technical barriers slow you down. Dive into the hackathon with confidence, armed with the tools you need to make the web decentralized than ever.

`Happy hacking!`
